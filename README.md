# Responsive privacy dialog

### What is this about?

- a pop-up a customer has to consent to before being able to proceed ("privacy dialog")
- simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- customer can either accept straight away or can adapt Cookies and Tracking in a second step (click on "Details - click me" button to get to further content)

### This Repo is based on:

- built from scratch according to delivered design / stakeholder request

### How to run this?

- clone project
- `cd` into project
- open `index.html` in your browser of choice (in my case, built in/for Chrome)

### ToDo

- refactor JavaScript
- toggle switch is not done yet!
